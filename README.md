## Design and develop a random color generator web application using React. This application will show a random color when a button is clicked:

- [x] A button with the exact text `Generate` will cause a new color to be generated when it is clicked
- [x] Once a color is generated, update the background color of a div which contains the exact text `Generated Color: <background color hex code>` (the background color and the hex code must match)
- [x] Allow user to specify hue.
- [x] Allow user to specify luminosity.
- [x] Allow user to specify size for the color box.
